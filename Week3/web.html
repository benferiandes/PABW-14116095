Brooklyn’s latest rap renaissance was born on the back of a bus, at the end of a long night. It was March of 2011, and Courtney “Jamal” Dewar, then 17 and known as Jay Steez, had just performed for some of his friends at a $10 cover night at a small soul food restaurant in Clinton Hill, where he wasn’t even listed on the bill. He told five of his buddies to meet him outside, where they started freestyling, performing for nobody but themselves. Not that it mattered. “We had the most legendary cypher,” says Joey Bada$$, Steez’ high school friend and rhyming partner. “Whatever it was, the vibe just felt so great. It felt so right with all of us rapping.”
